# Telegram Trading Bot

This provides a template for Telegram trading bot on Base Mainnet that uses the
[Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) SDK](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/cdp-sdk/docs/welcome)
and [MPC Wallet APIs](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/mpc-wallet/docs/welcome).

It stores wallet data in a local database using PouchDB, and is meant to be run locally.

> **NOTE: This sample app is for demonstration purposes only.** Make sure to persist your
> private keys, and deposit only small amounts of ETH to reduce the risk of losing your funds.

**Secure your wallet using [best practices](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/mpc-wallet/docs/wallets#securing-a-wallet). In production, you should [use the 2-of-2 CDP Server-Signer](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/mpc-wallet/docs/serversigners) with [IP whitelisting for your API key](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/docs/cdp-key-security) for increased security.**

## Feature requests

If there is specific functionality you'd like to see in the CDP SDK that is missing,
please [file it as an issue](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-sdk-nodejs/issues), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
